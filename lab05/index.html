                <p>Creating this webpage wasn’t easy, but after plenty of reading, exercises, and practice, I finally did it. 
                    Understanding the syntax wasn’t too challenging since I’ve worked with SQL before, which helped me approach learning HTML and CSS. 
                    The hardest part has been remembering all the elements, but repetition has made it easier over time.

                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <ol class="list">
                    <li>I learned the distinction between the bold element and the strong element.
                        The <b>bold</b> element is primarily used to grab the reader’s attention, while
                        the <strong>strong</strong> element conveys importance.</li>
                    <li>I also learned about the multiple ways to style HTML documents using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
                        For example, <span class="green-text">this is a big green sentence</span> and 
                        <span class="red-text">this is a small red one</span>.</li>
                    <li>Another thing I learned about was access to symbols that aren't on the keyboard.
                        The Konami Code is the most famous cheat code in video game history. It goes as follows:
                        &uarr; &uarr; &darr; &darr; &larr; &rarr; &larr; &rarr; B A START.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>I learned the fundamentals of HTML from the following sources:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">HTML Tutorial - W3Schools</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">HTML: HyperText Markup Language - MDN Web Docs</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Reflections</h3>

                <p>Lab02 was my reintroduction to HTML, and I found the syntax to be straightforward and easy to understand. 
                    At first, I felt overwhelmed by the number of elements available, but I soon realized that mastering the essential ones was enough. 
                    Working through the W3Schools tutorial helped reinforce my understanding and gave me a solid grasp of the fundamentals. 
                    This experience made me more confident in using HTML and prepared me for more advanced concepts.</p>

                <p>After completing the previous assignment, Lab03 was easier to understand. 
                    The biggest challenge was deciding how to style the HTML page. 
                    With so many possibilities, the design process was both exciting and somewhat time-consuming. 
                    At first, using a stylesheet felt overwhelming, but it ended up making the styling process much more efficient.</p>

                    <p>This assignment has been the most challenging so far. The main hurdle I had to overcome was applying the information to a preexisting file. I struggled to conceptualize a layout based on the previous lab we completed. To overcome this, I sketched out how I wanted the page to look visually. This approach helped me better organize my ideas and made the coding process much smoother.</p>
