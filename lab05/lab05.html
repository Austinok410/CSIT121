        This assignment has been the most challenging so far. The main hurdle I had to overcome was applying the information to a preexisting file. I struggled to conceptualize a layout based on the previous lab we completed. To overcome this, I sketched out how I wanted the page to look visually. This approach helped me better organize my ideas and made the coding process much smoother.
