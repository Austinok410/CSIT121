        Lab02 was my reintroduction to HTML, and I found the syntax to be straightforward and easy to understand. At first, I felt overwhelmed by the number of elements available, but I soon realized that mastering the essential ones was enough. Working through the W3Schools tutorial helped reinforce my understanding and gave me a solid grasp of the fundamentals. This experience made me more confident in using HTML and prepared me for more advanced concepts.
