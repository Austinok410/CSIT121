      <h1>Why is it important?</h1>

      <p>JSON is popular for many reasons and sees widespread use, underscoring its importance. By providing a consistent, text‑based structure, it simplifies data exchange between different languages, frameworks, and devices.</p>
      
      <p>Communication between clients and servers was not always as efficient as it is today. In the early days of the web, most pages were static, so a specialized data‑exchange format was unnecessary. As dynamic applications and complex back‑end services emerged, developers needed a lightweight, human‑readable way to send structured information and JSON filled that gap.</p>
      
      <p>Because JSON is easy for both people and computers to read, it has become the go‑to format for REST and GraphQL calls, mobile apps, and even everyday files like <code>package.json</code>. Its short syntax keeps network messages small, which saves bandwidth and speeds up pages—especially on phones.</p>
