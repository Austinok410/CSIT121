      <h1>What is it?</h1>

      <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text‑based format for organizing and sharing data. The first recorded JSON message was sent in April 2001 by Douglas Crockford and Chip Morningstar from a computer in Morningstar’s Bay Area garage.</p>
      
      <p>JSON is language‑independent. Its syntax resembles JavaScript object literals, but the format itself is plain text. Because it is just text, anyone can read it, and computers can easily convert it into usable data.</p>
      
      <p>JSON data is written as name–value pairs. These pairs have a field name enclosed in double quotes, followed by a colon and the corresponding value. As mentioned earlier, JSON uses a syntax similar to JavaScript, but with looser restrictions.</p>
