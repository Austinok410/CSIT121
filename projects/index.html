    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome, everyone! This page is the landing spot for navigating a few projects I completed over the semester. It’s interesting how quickly time has passed, and by the end of this journey I’ve picked up many new skills. The menu bar on the side links to the modules that taught me some very important lessons.</p>
    <p>Module 03: Learning HTML Basics introduced me to using a stylesheet for the first time and truly opened my eyes to the world of CSS. Even now, my YouTube algorithm serves me several videos about CSS and the many ways it can be used to enhance a site. As I continue my journey with web standards, I’m excited to see the level of expertise I can achieve, and I’ll be sure to revisit this module as a reminder of my humble beginnings.</p>
    <p>Module 07: Tables & Forms was exactly as it sounds. This module was impactful because something as simple as creating a table ended up taking me some time. I emphasized the importance of clean UI/UX—skills I’m still in the process of fully mastering. I also enjoyed the module because it gave me a chance to express my music taste.</p>
