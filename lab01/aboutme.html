            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Austin Okafor. I'm a 29-year-old Nigerian American residing in the lovely city of Baltimore.
                I try not to take myself too seriously and, as a result, have been labeled as "funny" by all my friends.
                I DJ full-time and have been blessed with opportunities to perform at Sony's headquarters in New York and 
                to tour in London as the DJ for the artist Sarina on R&B singer Luna Elle's tour. Before DJing became my career, 
                I had always been passionate about music and have been producing for about 10 years. 
                I have executive-produced several projects and even have placements with Sony-signed artist Lovemoor.
                Even before my love for music fully developed in high school, I always had a deep appreciation for technology. 
                Whenever I visited a thrift store, I would immediately head to the electronics section, 
                immersing myself in all the tech—from VHS players to radios. As I grew older, I became 
                the designated "family technician," a role that followed me into my professional life when I worked in 
                telecommunications as the Retail Operations Leader (a.k.a. store manager) at Cricket Wireless.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                
                My major at CCBC is Information Technology. I am currently enrolled in two courses: CSIT 101 and CSIT 121.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                Saying that I love music would be an understatement. With that passion comes several pastimes I enjoy.
                For starters, I love to DJ. I am part of a collective of DJs called FTG (From the Garage), 
                where we meet weekly to practice and refine our skills. I have also developed a passion for bowling. 
                While I’m not rolling 200+ games just yet, it’s definitely a great stress reliever.
                Calisthenics is another hobby of mine. Doing random push-ups throughout the day helps keep me mentally 
                focused—plus, the added bonus of bigger arms and a stronger chest doesn’t hurt.
